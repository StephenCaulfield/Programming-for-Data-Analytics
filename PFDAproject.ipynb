    "# 1.Introduction\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> For This Project I will be sythesizing a data set which details the sinking of the Titanic and analyzing the survival rate of people based on age, gender and class and their relationships to eachother. I will detail later in my investigation that I have done to substanciate my findings.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Project Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "* This project code and report is implemented on Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "* I am to create a synthesized or simulated data set using a real world phenomenon of my choosing(Survivors of the Titanic).\n",
    "* I will use python with the numpy package to create the distribution models.\n",
    "* I will determine what distribution models I should use through research on the topic.\n",
    "* I will discuss the output of my analysis a make a determination as to it's significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Reasons for Simulating Data\n",
    "<p>I will detail the advantages and disadvantages of simulating a data set to imitate social phenomon like the Titanic Sinking</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "* It gives a more detailed and unique perspective of the phenomenon, allowing us to precisely analyse what the outcomes are instead of making baseless presumptions.\n",
    "* It can predict how people will behave in potentially similar events.\n",
    "* It can help professionals develop law's, new technologies and philosophies that help improve our lives(e.g. increase survival rate of ship passengers)\n",
    "* Simulating these events is risk-free(No need to sink a ship for data analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "* Researcher-induced bias can potentially cause wildly different interpretations of the data.\n",
    "* A subjective analysis is necessary to derive meaning from the data set in social phenomenons.\n",
    "* Social phenomonons can change over time due to cultural and technological differences which can make these simulations appear dated very quickly.\n",
