for consideration: project could not be completed to satisfactory degree due to overwhelming conditions(Full time work + full time course), 
project specification was very unclear and "freedom" to pick data set only doomed this project to fail from beginning with what I had struggled to choose. Please consider rewriting project spec to be more clear to future students..
Response times on email and discussion forum post debilitating. Driven myself beyond a point of stress through every aspect of this project.
Lecture videos are unusually very understandable, while project is borderline incomprehensible.
